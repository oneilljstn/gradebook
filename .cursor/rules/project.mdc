# Project Tech Requirements

Before implementing code, read through these to make sure you follow our coding guide.

## NPM Requirements
when trying to install packages, always use npm or npx.  I do not use bun or pnpm or yarn.


## Component System
We are using ShadCN for our component library, always check if there is an existing shadcn component first before trying to implement you own.

## Form Library
We are using react-hook-form with client side validation using zod.  Make sure all forms have some type of client side validation

## Loader Buttons
All buttons should show a loader spinner inside them while the form is being submitted

## Data Fetching
We should always use useQuery and useMutation when trying to fetch or store data.  These should always invoke a tanstack server function.  See [-fetchIdeasFn.tsx](mdc:src/routes/-fetchIdeasFn.tsx) for an example of a server function for fetching.  See [-createIdeaFn.tsx](mdc:src/routes/-createIdeaFn.tsx) for example of a server function which does a mutation.
